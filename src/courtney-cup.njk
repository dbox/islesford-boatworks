        <h4>The rules!</h4>
        <p>The Cup is open to anyone and everyone, and the rules are simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The race is from the abutments, around the red bell buoy (or the middle green can for youth groups), and back again </li>
            <li>You time yourself, either from the boat or from someone on land</li>
            <li>Timing begins and ends when your bow crosses the end of the abutment farthest from the docks</li>
            <li>Groups of any size may participate in any rowboat - if you don’t have a boat, talk to Tony or Louise!</li>
            <li>Enough PFDs for the whole team need to be in the boat and worn by kids under 12. Talk to us if you need PFDs</li>
            <li>Our St. Ayles Skiff “Bridge” can be used by any group with 4 or more team members, but you must talk to Tony or Louise before taking the boat out
</li>
            <li>You can take as many tries as you like! Your best time will be used</li>
            <li>To be entered, you need to tell Louise your team name and time by <strong>{{ site.bwEndDate }}</strong>, the day before our launch</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summer evenings on Islesford, Courtney could often be found rowing between the Cranberry Isles with his three children, fishing, exploring, and practicing together in their two-station Whitehull, “Lightning.” Courtney was one of the biggest supporters of Boatworks’ Row-a-Thon events, helping to plan the course and practicing for hours in preparation. He believed in the value of traditional skills, and the community that can be built around them. He was also an incredible rower and fierce competitor who wanted to win a race around the island. The Courtney Cup is inspired by his enthusiastic spirit and love for all things on the water.</p>
