        <p>Join Little Cranberry Yacht Club and Islesford Boatworks for an evening of powerboating and crafting with power tools. This adult program is intended to teach the basics of these skills, but all skill levels are welcome. We will also provide ouers d'oeuvres and (non-alcoholic) drinks, and you will get to take your wooden craft home with you! </p>
        <p>Ladies Night is a program created specifically for women and non-binary people to learn how to use powertools and powerboats. These skills are important in daily island life, but are historically inaccessible to people other than men. LCYC and IBW have teamed up with this event series to help make these activities accessible to all! As with all of our programs, feel free to attend as many or as few of these events as youâ€™d like. Each evening will be slightly different, but skills will not directly build upon each other. </p>
