        <p>Though we have been hosting this jam since 2015, this weekly gathering has deep roots in the island community. Originally hosted by Hugh Smallwood in his home, this jam has brought islanders and the extended community together for over 20 years. It has always been the best kind of jam, a supportive space for everyone regardless of skill level to play together. After Hughâ€™s passing, we try to honor what he created by continuing his jam in our shop.</p>
    <p>
Our jam usually revolves around americana classics, fiddle tunes, and other well-known songs but it is open to all types of genres. Bring a song or two and join us each week! It's free and open to all. </p>
